# Magisk builds

These are my personal Magisk builds (straight from topjohnwu's repo).

You can subscribe to them by adding

https://nathanchance.me/downloads/magisk/updater.json

as the custom update channel in Magisk settings. These are signed with my personal keystore so you will need to uninstall any versions of Magisk Manager you already have installed.

By running these builds, you accept you are running alpha software that is in constant development, for which there is no support. The official Magisk threads are for versions that topjohnwu has released himself; you should NOT request support for these builds in those thread. If there are any issues, please see the [unofficial builders thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/unofficial-magisk-v10-beta-built-t3521901) to see if it has been reported there already.
