# Magisk builds

These are my personal Magisk builds (straight from topjohnwu's repo).

You can subscribe to them by adding

https://nathanchance.me/downloads/magisk/updater.json

as the custom update channel in Magisk settings. These are signed with my personal keystore so you will need to uninstall any versions of Magisk Manager you already have installed.

I DO NOT provide support for these.
